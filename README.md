# Hey there, I'm Cluster!

### Who am i?

I'm Cluster, a very new developer in general, only starting in 2018, on the Roblox platform. I've been learning
(Roblox's) Lua for the past 3 years now, though I still consider myself a beginner, only being able to make
basic concepts that half work.


### Why roblox?

I started on Roblox because my little brother showed me the platform, and saw I could make [games](https://www.roblox.com/users/675796106/profile), and decided
to try it out. I've made some really good friends on the platform and I don't regret a single moment of it!


### Do you go by any different names?

I do actually, the only other name I go by [leshark](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO5nYGACDY81kFln5tjTXpA) (including some variation with ending suffixes). If you do 
encounter me in the wild, say hi!


### How active will you create or contribute code?

I have no idea, but I hope to start doing it more often as I learn the ropes of programming and understand more languanges!
